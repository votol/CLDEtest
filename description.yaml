  #properties are values which influence the calculation process but not the result 
  #(except some accuracy issues)
  #ccs introduce two default properties: output_path, and tmp_path
  #output_path - the destination, where to put the result .nc file
  #tmp_path - folder where could be placed some tmp files. ccs will check for this folder and delete it after the work finished (with success or failure)
  #you should not redefine this properties
  #Here should go the list of items, each of which describes single property
  - name: cl_device_type # this property should take two values GPU or CPU
    optional: true # a boolean property which shows if this property is required for calculation. Default: false 
    list: false #flag to show that if need to set a list of properties here. Default: false
    type: string #shows the type of the property: currently we support only int, string, float, boolean  
  - name: cl_device_number
    optional: true # a boolean property which shows if this property is required for calculation. Default: false
